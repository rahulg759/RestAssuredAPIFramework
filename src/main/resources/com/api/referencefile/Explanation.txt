For getting API Key ==>>
stripe.com < dashboard < api keys < secret key (https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
Bullet Points :
1- Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.

In Postman:
1 -Authorization < select basic Auth type < give username  secret key (get from dashboard < developers < api keys)
2 -We can provide optional parameters like email,address line 1 etc in Params. (For post request - create customer)
3 -If we are getting the status code for post 200 or 201 , its dependend upon developers.
4 -We can use basic Auth in Header as Authorization with Bearer auth key

Get Auth Key :
1 -Go to https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/create (In docs section)
2 -select customer < create customer < select java from key
3 -Get API key < select cURL


Verification :
1 -For CRUD operation perfomed in customer apis , we need to validate from customer section in dashboard (https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
2 -In Customer section (Dashboard) - add one customer id with new btn-
